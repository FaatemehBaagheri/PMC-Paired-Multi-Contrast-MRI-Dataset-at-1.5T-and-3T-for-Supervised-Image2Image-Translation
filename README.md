# PMC: Paired Multi-Contrast MRI Dataset at 1.5T and 3T for Supervised Image2Image Translation
The PMC dataset comprises MR images from 181 subjects, preciously crafted in both 2D and 3D to accommodate a diverse range of models compatible with each of these formats. This dataset is pre-processed and ready to use for supervised and semi-supervised learning methods in tasks, such as cross-modality, high-field MR image prediction, super-resolution, and multi-contrast MR image translation. It includes paired MR images in T1, T2, and PD contrasts at both 1.5T and 3T for the same pseudo-subjects.
